       parcel as a bundler for customaization or we can configure our app according to our requorement


     $ - We used tailwind for styling, so we installed and configure it

        - # We'll use Grid system   => grid grid-flow-col  : col-span-1 & col-span-11


     $ - For state management, we will use RTK

          - install both libraraies
          - craete a store and configure it 
          - create a slice and and export it and give it to store
          - provide the store to app root comp

          - to check whther check the store is working or not either use useSelector or use extension

          - dispatch an action in haeder.js and put a handler on onclick event
          - for subscriping use useSelector hook in SideBar.js
          - we will do early return, control will not go to next line

          => What is happening :- "when we click on this humburger menu btn, action is dispatched which calls a 
                                  reducer function which modifies the slice of our Redux store and since our
                                  SideBar comp is subscribed to our Redux store, it automagically updates"


    $ - We will make a button list using map funnction



    $ - We will use free youtube Videos API to fetch and display Videos data
         - Lets use most popular videos list and copy http address

        - then generate a google api key using youtube api key auth


    $ - We will make an API call in VideoContainer comp using useEffect
